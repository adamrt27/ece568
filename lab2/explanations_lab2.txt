Part 1:

I started by building a merkle tree based on the values. To generate proofs, I 
went through the tree, starting at the leaf corresponding to the hashedValue,
and then went up the tree, adding the sibling of the current node to the proof, 
then moving to the parent of the current node. I repeated this process until I
reached the root of the tree. I appended the signature of the root to the proof
and returned the proof. 

To verify the proof, I started by retrieving the hashedValue from the provided 
proof. I then generated the proof using the hashedValue and compared the 
generated proof to the provided proof. If the two proofs were the same, 
then I knew that the proof was valid. I checked the validity of the proof by
checking the signature of the generated proof against the signature of the
supplied proof.

Part 2:

I created a X509 certificate in this part. I started by creating a Certificate
Signing Request (CSR) using the provided subject details. I then signed the CSR
using the private key loaded from the provided PEM file. I printed the CSR in
PEM format. I then loaded the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate and private
key to generate an X509 certificate. I set the attributes of the certificate
including the issuer, serial number, validity period, public key, and key
extensions. I then signed the certificate with the CA key and printed the CA
and signed certificates, forming a certificate chain.
