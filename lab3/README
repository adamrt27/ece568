# Part 1 Explanation
This is an example of persistant XSS.

Input this code into the search bar, and it generates a login form. The login form submits its
contents to the server via a POST request.

# Part 2 Explanation
This script performs an XSS attack by extracting a secret value from an input field with name "secret".
It then finds the form element, sets its message field with the stolen secret value and automatically 
submits the form to a target endpoint, with the receiver set as "guest", which is the attacker. This 
allows an attacker to steal sensitive data without user interaction.

# Part 3 Explanation
This script intercepts the submission of a form named "ece568-csrf-transfer" and sends a forged message to 
the parent window. Then we add an event listener to the form such that on the transfer form submission, the 
window posts the message to a desired user instead with certain values. In this case, we want to post a message 
to the attack (guest) with money amount of 9999.

# Part 4 Explanation
The script exploits a CSRF token bypass by leveraging a CSS vulnerability and the same-origin policy. It first loads the legitimate transfer form in an iframe (frame1), where JavaScript extracts the hidden CSRFToken field. Once retrieved, the token is appended to a forged request in a second iframe (frame2), which submits an unauthorized transfer. This works because the browser allows scripts from the same origin to access content across iframes, bypassing CSRF protection despite token-based security measures.

# Part 5 Explanation
This is an example of SQL injection. ORing the condition '1'='1' will always return true, so the
query will return all rows in the table. 

# Part 6 Explanation
The first line uses the UPDATE command to update the salary of user 101.
The second line sets a trigger to update the email of any user that is inserted into the table to
'ece568-24f@utoronto.ca'.

# Part 7 Explanation
This finds the pin of the credit card with the number '2023110120231101'. I checked different
pins and found that the pin for this card is 3584.
